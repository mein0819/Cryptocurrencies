# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to preprocess Crytocurrency data to create a report showing what currencies are on the trading market and grouping them based on features into a classification system using unsupervised machine learning techniques and algorithms. The sklearn library will be used for the classification and visualizations will be done using hvplot and plotly libraries imported from Pandas.
